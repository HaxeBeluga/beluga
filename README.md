Beluga
======

Beluga is a framework helping the creation of browser game websites. Based on Haxe technology, it allows any developer to define the environment of its project.

Acting as a toolbox, Beluga provides different services such as account system, forum, guild, market, survey and so on. Absolutely non-intrusive, the developer is free to choose and use any of them which suits the best to her/his needs. Moreover, Beluga offers a flexible and modular API allowing the developer to add her/his own services.

Beluga is also open-source and communal, contributors are encouraged to participate to its development. Then, thanks to its powerful architecture, developers have the opportunity to contributes without removing the compatibility with previous versions of the project.
